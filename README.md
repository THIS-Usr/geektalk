#Geektalk

Geektalk is a small demo of how RDF can be used in a JS application to easily integrate data from different APIs.

Geektalk is built using a number of libraries we have developed to make the use of RDF and other semantic technologies in JS easier:

- [RDFStore-JS](https://github.com/antoniogarrote/rdfstore-js)
- [SemanticKO](https://github.com/antoniogarrote/semantic-ko)
- [JSON-LD Macros](https://github.com/antoniogarrote/json-ld-macros)

All this libraries are free software and can be cloned and modified from their Github repositories.

To use the application just get the code and open *index.html* in a (modern) browser.
